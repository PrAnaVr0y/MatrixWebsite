    Hamlet:<br>
     You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward!<br>
     You are as stupid as the difference between a handsome rich brave<br>
     hero and thyself! Speak your mind!<br><br>
    
     You are as brave as the sum of your fat little stuffed misused dusty<br>
     old rotten codpiece and a beautiful fair warm peaceful sunny summer's<br>
     day. You are as healthy as the difference between the sum of the<br>
     sweetest reddest rose and my father and yourself! Speak your mind!<br>
    
     You are as cowardly as the sum of yourself and the difference<br>
     between a big mighty proud kingdom and a horse. Speak your mind.<br><br>
    
     Speak your mind!<br><br>

    Hamlet:<br>

    [Enter Ophelia]<br><br>
    
    Hamlet:<br>
     Thou art as lovely as the product of a large rural town and my amazing<br>
     bottomless embroidered purse. Speak thy mind!<br><br>
    
     Thou art as loving as the product of the bluest clearest sweetest sky<br>
     and the sum of a squirrel and a white horse. Thou art as beautiful as<br>
     the difference between Juliet and thyself. Speak thy mind!<br><br>
    
    [Exeunt Ophelia and Hamlet]<br><br>

    Romeo:<br>
     Speak your mind. You are as worried as the sum of yourself and the<br>
     difference between my small smooth hamster and my nose. Speak your<br>
     mind!<br><br>
    
    Juliet:<br>
     Speak YOUR mind! You are as bad as Hamlet! You are as small as the<br>
     difference between the square of the difference between my little pony<br>
     and your big hairy hound and the cube of your sorry little<br>
     codpiece. Speak your mind!<br><br>

    [Enter Ophelia]<br><br>
    
    Juliet:<br>
     Thou art as good as the quotient between Romeo and the sum of a small<br>
     furry animal and a leech. Speak your mind!<br><br>
    
    Ophelia:<br>
     Thou art as disgusting as the quotient between Romeo and twice the<br>
     difference between a mistletoe and an oozing infected blister! Speak<br>
     your mind!<br><br> 
    [Exeunt]
